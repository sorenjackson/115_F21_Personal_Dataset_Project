Description: For my initial Analysis, I decided to take the summary function of my Personal Dataset, after comparing 5 data points each from COVID-19 case data
between black and white people.


MOTIVATION: Covid-19 has caused a wide variety of problems, as well as some previously unheard-of solutions, including the development of mRNA vaccines, which was meant to address
the slow process of which vaccines were previously developed. One problem that remains persistant is the issue of health disparities when it comes to minority groups (mainly
people of color) and how they deal with covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to white people. I wanted to center my project around this issue in hopes that it can
bring enough attention to the general public, and maybe the right person (or people) can come up with a solid, data-based solution.
