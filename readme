Description: For my initial Analysis, I decided to take the summary function of my Personal Dataset, after comparing 5 data points each from COVID-19 case data
between black and white people. [EDITED: Upon further analysis, I've adjusted my summary function to match the new data I've entered since I started this project.]

MOTIVATION: 

Covid-19 has caused a wide variety of problems, as well as some previously unheard-of solutions, including the development of mRNA vaccines, which was meant to address
the slow process of which vaccines were previously developed. One problem that remains persistant is the issue of health disparities when it comes to minority groups and how they
deal with covid-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths compared to white people. I wanted to center my project around this issue in hopes that it can bring enough attention to
the general public, and maybe the right person (or people) can come up with a solid, data-based solution.

DATA PROCESS: 

My main and sole resource for my Personal Dataset is the CDC website for Covid-19 Data (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographicsovertime). I was
notably pleased by how organized and structured their data was, considering the sheer amount of it they had to work with. I started by collecting data on new covid cases in the US
(per 100,000) from August 7th to October 30th, with each data point being separated by week (13 weeks total), and then comparing them by race. The three ethnic groups I chose to 
highlight were White, Black, and Indigenous/Islander (AI/AN, NH). Making my own .csv file, I simply translated the data points into respective columns divided by case rates by
race, as well as death rates by race, with rows separated by date of cases reported.
